# youtube-adview-prediction
**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the number of views a YouTube advertisement will receive using a dataset containing various features such as likes, dislikes, comments, and video duration. Machine learning models are applied to make these predictions based on the provided features.
**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations to understand data patterns and relationships.
Model Selection: Testing regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
**Datasets**
train.csv: This file contains the training data used to build the prediction model, including features like views, likes, dislikes, comments, and others.
test.csv: This file is used to evaluate the performance of the model and make predictions on unseen data.
